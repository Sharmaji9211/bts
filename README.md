## Installation

### ESP32 Firmware

1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pio lib install "Adafruit SSD1306" "DHT sensor library" "WebSockets" "ArduinoJson"
   ```

```
Update WiFi credentials in config.h:

cpp
const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
Upload code to ESP32

Server Setup
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install express ws
Start the server:

bash
npm start
Usage
Power on the ESP32 system

Access dashboard at http://localhost:81

Monitor real-time data:

Occupancy count

Temperature/Humidity

Air quality index

Control modes:

Auto: System-controlled based on thresholds

Manual: Direct control from dashboard

Dashboard Features
Real-time sensor data visualization

Historical data graphs

Manual override controls

Alert notifications

System status indicators

Mobile-responsive design

Configuration
Modify config.h for:

cpp
// Environmental thresholds
#define MAX_TEMP 28          // ¬∞C
#define MIN_TEMP 18
#define GAS_THRESHOLD 1000   // ppm

// Timing intervals
#define SEND_INTERVAL 2000   // ms
#define RECONNECT_TIME 3000  // ms
Troubleshooting
Port Conflict:

bash
# Find process using port 81
sudo lsof -i :81
# Kill process
kill -9 <PID>
Sensor Errors:

Check wiring connections

Verify sensor power supply

Calibrate MQ2 sensor

WebSocket Issues:

Verify ESP32 WiFi connection

Check server accessibility

Inspect browser console logs

Safety Precautions
Use proper insulation for high-voltage components

Maintain adequate ventilation for gas sensor

Keep system away from water sources

Regularly inspect electrical connections
